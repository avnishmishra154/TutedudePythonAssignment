## Program 1 Functionality

1. For taking input, I have used `input()` function. This function is used to take input from the user and the input always be in a string form, so then after I converted string into int by adding `int(input())` into the code.

2. I have used different arithmetic operators for performing the code:
   - `+` (Addition)
   - `-` (Subtraction)
   - `*` (Multiplication)
   - `//` (Integer Division)

3. I have used `print()` to print the output.

## Program 2 Functionality

1. I have taken input as string using `input()` function.

2. To concatenate 2 variables I have used `+` operator.

3. For printing greeting I have used `print()` with f-string formatting (`f""`).
