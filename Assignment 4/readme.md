# File Handling Tasks in Python

## Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors

### Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Opens and reads a text file named **`sample.txt`**.
2. Prints its content line by line.
3. Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.

### Expected Behavior
- If **`sample.txt`** exists, the program should display its contents line by line.
- If the file does **not** exist, the program should print an appropriate error message without crashing.

## Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File

### Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes user input and writes it to a file named **`output.txt`**.
2. Appends additional data to the same file.
3. Reads and displays the final content of the file.

### Expected Behavior
- The program should first write user-provided input to **`output.txt`**.
- It should then append additional user input to the same file.
- Finally, it should read and display the complete contents of **`output.txt`** after all writing and appending operations.
